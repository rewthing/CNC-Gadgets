This will be a collection of miscellaneous files in either DXF or Vectric VCarve/Aspire format (.crv / .crv3d), which are too simple to merit their own project archive.

## NEMA Outlet Templates

This is a collection of templates for creating wall plates to cover North American standard electrical devices (toggle switches, outlets, etc.)  It contains guides to align from 1 to 8 devices in a gang layout with proper spacing.
